      HELLO

      Swagger has been honing their original brand of Celtic music at festivals
      and concert halls across the United States since 2007. Well known for
      their high-energy stage performances and catchy original songs, Swagger’s
      music is the expected Irish celebration of drink, mischief, and music,
      which also dares to explore oppression and take an emigrant’s perspective
      on the virtues and vices of the Irish-American culture.
